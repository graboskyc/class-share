# Stream Deck
If using an [elgato StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) or I guess any other macro/keyboard shortcut solution, you can use this bash script to make the next slide or entry appear.

Edit the script to have your path to the `remoteToggleVis` hook as shown in the Stitch UI along with the name of the class you want to work with and your email and password.

Then on the Stream Deck, have it launch an app and set it to the script. I have a sample icon here, too.
